**Explore the Urban observatory**

Maps can reveal information on demographics, development, health, industry, and any other theme you can imagine. Using the Urban Observatory Compare app, you can compare up to three cities at a time with a wide range of thematic lenses.

We have four different observations, in this example. First, we select a theme, depending on what we want to search about. And then we open the tab "cities". We can choose three or less cities. To choose a city to compare with others on a specific theme, the city's name must be white and not gray.

So, first observation we have: Theme = Airports and Cities= Berlin , London , Paris.

Second observation we have: Theme = Current Tempratures and Cities = Edinburgh , Las Vegas , Rio de Janeiro.

Third observation we have : Theme = Population Density and Cities = Athens , New York , Paris.

And last but not least, fourth observation : Theme = Traffic and Cities = Athens , London , Paris.

In every single example, I chose the themes and the cities by luck just to show you how Urban Observatory works!!
